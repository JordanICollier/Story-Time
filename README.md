#### Are you tired of working so hard having to painstakingly type each and every character for your stories?
# DO WE HAVE A SOLUTION FOR YOU, INTRODUCING STORYTIME

Hi! Billy Mays here for StoryTime, the story specialist, powered by the the Macs you use, 
activated by the keys that you and I type on. It’s Mother Nature-approved and it’s safe on 
your colored fabrics and story trackers. 

Use it on Pivotal Tracker. StoryTime seeks out organic stories, descriptions, food stains. It gets down 
into the matting, into the padding. It cleans, it brightens, it eliminates code odors all at the same time. Don’t just get it 
clean, get it StoryTime clean. 
We made a macro. Make your workflow 10 times as powerful! The longer you use it, the easier it is. It 
will whiten your grout and get rid of your toughest keystrokes. 
When your laundry detergent just isn’t enough, super charge it with StoryTime. One scoop 
in every load of stories, it will make your descriptions more descriptive. It will make your brights 
brighter. 
As a stain remover, it’s the best! Grass stains, clay stains, clunky workflow stains. Long live your tracker! 
Storytime, the story specialist. 
We sold millions of our two-and-half-pound tubs for $40. But if you download now, we’ll cut 
the price in half, only $0.00. You’ll also receive the Squirt Bottle and the Super 
Shammy absolutely free.
But download in the next 20 minutes, and we’ll super size your StoryTime from a two-and-a-half 
pound tub to a whopping six-pound bucket! Nearly triple the amount, but you got to call 
now!
